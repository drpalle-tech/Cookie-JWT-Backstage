The project talks about the authenticationa and authorization process for .NET Core web applications.

Includes a web application with the logic to authenticate and authorize using custom cookie.
Includes a stand alone Web API project, used by the same web app, to validate and authorize the users via JWT authentication mode.

If not validated, the black sheeps are printed out :P
